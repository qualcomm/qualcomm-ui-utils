# QUI Utils

QUI is a collection of high-quality, reusable UI components that can be used to build beautiful and responsive web applications. It features a cross-framework core layer for unification of styling and behavior, as well as framework adapters for React and Angular.

This repository contains utility scripts that support the development of the main [QUI repository](https://github.com/qualcomm/qualcomm-ui).
